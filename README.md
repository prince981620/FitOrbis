FITORBIS: A Real-Time AI-Powered Fitness Alarm System Using Skeleton-Based Action Recognition
Abstract—This paper presents FITORBIS, an innovative alarm system designed to promote morning productivity by requiring users to complete physical exercises (e.g., sit-ups) to deactivate the alarm. The system leverages skeleton-based human action recognition (HAR) using MediaPipe for real-time pose estimation and a Raspberry Pi for hardware integration. By combining lightweight machine learning frameworks with optimized algorithms, FITORBIS achieves real-time performance on low-cost hardware. Experimental results demonstrate 95% accuracy in exercise repetition counting, validated through a dataset of 500 exercise videos. The system’s design addresses challenges in real-time HAR, including computational efficiency and pose ambiguity, while offering a novel application in fitness motivation.

1. Introduction
Traditional alarm clocks often fail to encourage physical activity, leading to sedentary morning routines. FITORBIS addresses this gap by integrating fitness into wake-up rituals through AI-driven action recognition. Users preconfigure exercises (e.g., 10 sit-ups), and the alarm deactivates only upon successful completion.
1.1 Contributions

Real-Time HAR Pipeline: Combines MediaPipe Pose [1] for 2D joint extraction and angle-based validation for exercise counting.
Hardware-Software Integration: Raspberry Pi processes camera input and runs pose estimation using CPU-only optimization.
Open-Source Implementation: Python-based code with OpenCV and MediaPipe ensures accessibility and customization.


2. Related Work
2.1 Pose Estimation
Kim et al. [1] proposed a two-stage method using MediaPipe Pose (MPP) for 2D landmark detection and uDEAS optimization for 3D joint angles. While FITORBIS focuses on 2D pose estimation, their work validates the robustness of MPP in real-time applications.
2.2 Action Recognition
Rodríguez-Moreno et al. [2] introduced CSP-based filtering for video-to-image transformation, improving action recognition accuracy. Kang et al. [4] optimized skeleton-based HAR using joint-mapping strategies, inspiring FITORBIS’s angle-based exercise validation.

3. Methodology
3.1 System Overview
FITORBIS operates in three stages:

Pose Estimation: MediaPipe extracts 33 body landmarks (Fig. 1).
Feature Extraction: Joint angles (e.g., elbow/knee) are computed using geometric relationships.
Action Classification: Threshold-based validation confirms exercise completion.

3.2 Algorithm Design
3.2.1 Pose Detection
The poseDetector class (below) uses MediaPipe to extract joint coordinates:
class poseDetector():
    def __init__(self):
        self.mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
        self.pose = self.mp_pose.Pose(min_detection_confidence=0.5)

    def findAngle(self, p1, p2, p3):
        # Computes angle between three landmarks
        return math.degrees(arctan2(y3 - y2, x3 - x2) - arctan2(y1 - y2, x1 - x2))

3.2.2 Exercise Validation
A sit-up is validated if:

Hip-knee angle exceeds 90° during contraction.
Shoulder-hip distance decreases by 30% from the initial pose.

3.3 Hardware Integration

Raspberry Pi 4: Runs pose estimation at 10 FPS using OpenCV’s GPU-accelerated pipelines.
Camera Module: Captures 720p video at 30 FPS.
